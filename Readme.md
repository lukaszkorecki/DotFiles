# DEPRECATED

Everything lives in my Emacs config now. Go there :point_down:

### Thanks for checking out my dotfiles

> There's no place like ~/.DotFiles

## Back in the day

I've started with a lot of borrowed stuff from random forums and websites created around 1998.

Then I switched to oh-my-zsh.
Then I removed it.
Then I switched back to Bash.


## So

This repo is not a framework or anything.  I've been stripping down
the dependencies so that the configs and tweaks stay as small as possible.

Here's what you'll find here:

# `bins/`

I've written and accumulated a lot of scripts which help me with my
day-to-day tasks. Some are quite useful (`git-` extensions), some
are somewhat-useful (`fcrypt`) and some are just ridiculous (`faces`,
`imgcat`)


## The rest

The rest are of course configs for various pieces of software I use
every day.

# Emacs

(where most of the stuff happens anyway)

- My Emacs configuration can be found at [lukaszkorecki/cult-leader](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader)


# Supported OSs

85% of my time I'm working in a Linux VM (powered by
[lukaszkorecki/dev-machine](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/dev-machine)
so it's guaranteed that these configs will work in Linux.

The other 15% is spent in OSX so I make sure stuff works there too.

# The Setup

### You'll need this:

- git
- make

### How To

```bash
    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:lukaszkorecki/DotFiles.git .DotFiles # it HAS to be .DotFiles
    cd .DotFiles
    make setup
```
