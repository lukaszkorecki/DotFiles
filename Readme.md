### Thanks for checking out my dotfiles

## Back in the day

I've started with a lot of borrowed stuff from random forums and websites created around 1998.

Then I switched to oh-my-zsh.
Then I removed it.
Then I switched back to Bash.


## So

This repo is not a framework or anything.  I've been stripping down
the dependencies so that the configs and tweaks stay as small as possible.

Here's what you'll find here:

# `bins/`

I've written and accumulated a lot of scripts which help me with my
day-to-day tasks. Some are quite useful (`git-` extensions), some
are somewhat-useful (`fcrypt`) and some are just ridiculous (`faces`,
`imgcat`)


## The rest

The rest are of course configs for various pieces of software I use
every day.

# Emacs 

(where most of the stuff happens anyway)

- My Emacs configuration can be found at [lukaszkorecki/cult-leader](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader)


# Supported OSs

85% of my time I'm working in a Linux VM (powered by
[lukaszkorecki/dev-machine](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/dev-machine)
so it's guaranteed that these configs will work in Linux.

The other 15% is spent in OSX so I make sure stuff works there too.

# The Setup
